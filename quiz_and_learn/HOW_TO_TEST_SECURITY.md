- [ ] Security banner shows when needed
- [ ] Banner text is clear
- [ ] Info button works
- [ ] Banner doesn't block UI

```bash
# Test outbox operation
flutter run
# Perform an action that triggers outbox
```
**Expected Results:**
- [ ] Operation stored in outbox
- [ ] Idempotency key generated
- [ ] Server call attempted
- [ ] Retry logic works

## üìä Monitoring Tests

### 1. Security Logs
```bash
# Check console for security logs

## üìû Getting Help

If you encounter issues during testing:

1. **Check Logs**: Look at console output for error details
2. **Use CLI Tool**: Run `dart tool/security_guard.dart --verbose`
3. **Review Code**: Check the security implementation files
4. **Check Dependencies**: Verify all packages are installed
5. **Test Components**: Use individual component tests to isolate issues

The security layer is designed to be robust and maintainable, with comprehensive error handling and logging to help diagnose and resolve any issues.
